##### Basic steps we use to construct a data analysis.

##### SemProj Part d) Present your final models and learnings

  * Present your results
  * Present reproducible code
  * Comparison to other modeling approaches in the literature

#### Supervised and Unsupervised Learning

Two broad families of algorithms will be covered: 

  * Unsupervised learning algorithms
  * Supervised learning algorithms

##### Unsupervised learning 

In unsupervised learning, 

  - the algorithm will seek to find the structure that organizes unlabelled data. 

##### Supervised learning 

In supervised learning, 

  - we know the class or the level of some observations of a given target attribute. 

#### Classification and Regression Problems

There are basically two types of problems that predictive modeling deals with: 

  * Classification problems 
  * Regression problems

##### Classification

In some cases, we want to predict which group an observation is part of. 

Here, we are dealing with a quality of the observation. 

##### Regression

In other cases, we want to predict an observation's level on an attribute. 

Here, we are dealing with a quantity, and this is a regression problem. 

#### The critical role of domain knowledge 

  * in modeling and prediction

Domain knowledge informs and is informed by data understanding. 

  * The understanding of the data 
    - then informs how the data has to be prepared. 

The next step is data modeling, 

  * which can also lead to further data preparation. 

Data models have to be evaluated, 

  * and this evaluation can be informed by field knowledge, 
    - which is also updated through the data mining process. 

Finally, 

  * if the evaluation is satisfactory, 
    - the models are deployed for prediction. 


#### Caveat: For Predictive Analytics

Of course, predictions are not always accurate, 

  * and some have written about the caveats of data science. 

What do you think about the relationship between 

  * the attributes titled Predictor and Outcome on the following plot? 

![Relationship between Predictor & Outcome](./figs/lpar-caveat.png)


It seems like there is a relationship between the two. 

  * For the statistically inclined, 
      - I tested its significance:
        - r = 0.4195, p = .0024. 
  * The value p is the probability of obtaining a relationship of this strength or stronger 
      - if there is actually no relationship between the attributes. 
  * ( This is the p-value of hypothesis testing, if p<0.05 
      - typically we assert we can reject the null hypothesis)
  * We could conclude that the relationship between these variables 
      - in the population they come from is quite reliable, 
      - **right?**
    
##### No: Lets think about this

Believe it or not, 

  * the population these observations come from 
      - is that of randomly generated numbers. 
  * We generated a data frame of 50 columns 
      - of 50 randomly generated numbers. 
  * We then examined all the correlations (manually) 
      - and generated a scatterplot of the two attributes 
      - with the largest correlation we found. 
    
##### The code is provided here, 

We'll use runif()

  * help(runif)
    - The Uniform Distribution
    - Description
    - These functions provide information about the uniform distribution on the interval from min to max. 
      - dunif gives the density, 
      - punif gives the distribution function 
      - qunif gives the quantile function and 
      - runif generates random deviates.

```{r,echo=TRUE}
set.seed(1)
DF = data.frame(matrix(nrow = 50,ncol = 50))
for (i in 1:50) {
  DF[,i] = runif(50)
}

plot(DF[[2]],DF[[16]], xlab = "Predictor", ylab = "Outcome")
abline(lm(DF[[2]]~DF[[16]]))
cor.test(DF[[2]], DF[[16]])

```

  * in case you want to check it yourself
  - line 1 sets the seed so that you find the same results as we did, 
  - line 2 generates to the data frame, 
  - line 3-5 the for loop fills it with random numbers, column by column, 
  - line 7 generates the scatterplot, 
  - line 8 fits the regression line, and 
  - line 9 tests the significance of the correlation:

Normally we reject the null with a p-value of <0.05

  * i.e. we'll be wrong 5% of the time
    - in a set of 20 trials
  
Here we did 50 trials

  * And cherry picked the best correlation
    - But its all randomly generated numbers
    - There is no predictive or causal relationship
  * And we'd only recognize this if we consider
    - That our p-value is reported for 1 trial
    - But we run many trials

##### [Bonferroni Correction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonferroni_correction) for multiple comparisons

How could this relationship happen given that the odds were 2.4 in 1000 ? 

  * Well, think of it; 
    - we correlated all 50 attributes 2 x 2, 
    - which resulted in 2,450 tests 
      - (not considering the correlation of each attribute with itself). 
  * Such spurious correlation was quite expectable. 

The usual threshold below which we consider a relationship significant is p = 0.05. 

  * This means that we expect to be wrong once in 20 times.
  * You would be right to suspect that there are other significant correlations 
    - in the generated data frame (there should be approximately 125 of them in total). 
  * This is the reason why we should always correct the number of tests. 
  * In our example, 
    - as we performed 2,450 tests, 
    - our threshold for significance 
    - should be 0.0000204 (0.05 / 2450).
  * This is called the Bonferroni correction.

#### Overfitting: The need for Training and Testing Datasets

Spurious correlations are always a possibility in data analysis 

  * and this should be kept in mind at all times. 

A related concept is that of overfitting. 

  * Overfitting happens, for instance, 
    - when a weak classifier bases its prediction on the noise in data. 
  * We will discuss overfitting when discussing
    - Training datasets for fit a model to
    - Testing datasets for evaluating the goodness of fit
      - when using various types of cross-validation
    - And when evaluating $Predictive, Adjusted, R^2$
