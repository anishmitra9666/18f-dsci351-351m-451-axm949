#### Syllabus

#### Tidyverse thinking

##### Hadley Wickham Talk on Tidyverse

Watch this one for class

  - [Hadley Wickham on Tidyverse](https://youtu.be/K-ss_ag2k9E)

Alternatively here is a more extended version

  - [RConf-Jan 2017: Data Science in the Tidyverse](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/videos/data-science-in-the-tidyverse/)
  And slides 
  
##### Hadley has a great book on making R packages

Its available to read online

  - [R Packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/)

##### Purrr is another part of the Tidyverse

purrr enhances R's functional programming (FP) toolkit 

  - by providing a complete and consistent set of tools 
  - for working with functions and vectors. 
  
If you've never heard of FP before, 

  - Check Wikipedia first
    - [Functional Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)
  - the best place to start is 
  - the family of map() functions 
    - which allow you to replace many for loops 
    - with code that is both more succinct and easier to read. 

The best place to learn about the map() functions 

  - is the iteration chapter in R for data science.
