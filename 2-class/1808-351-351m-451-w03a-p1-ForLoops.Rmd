#### Some Simple Rmd Items 

##### Rmd for Exploratory Data Analysis
 
  - EDA is a foundation of Data Science
  - Identify sources of data for your problem
  - Need to acquire, assemble, clean, and explore your data
  - An environment for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  

##### R markdown is tool for Open Science

  - Reproducible data analysis
  - Incorporating Data, Code, Presentation and Reporting
  - Good coding practices are essential
  - Comment your code, describe your data frames
  - Make your data analyses a presentation and report.
   
##### Rcode in Rmd, delineated by three backticks{r}

```{r,echo=TRUE,message=TRUE}
options("digits" = 5)
options("digits.secs" = 3)
```
 
##### Code in Rmd is delinearted 

  - three backticks for code blocks
  - one tick for inline code
 
##### YAML settings and commenting
  - This is the top block of the Rmd file
    - set off by three dashes ---  
  - In the YAML Header, you can comment lines with ' #### ' 
    - But in the body, ' #### ' is a second level header!

##### Commenting in the Rmd body
  - To comment in the Rmd body, use html comment form
    - < ! - - Comment - - >  
    - but with no spaces between the characters
      - <!-- regular html comment --> 
      -  i.e.' <!-- ' starts a comment block  
      -  ''' --> ''' ends a comment block  

<!--
  So this is a comment block  
  
   In the YAML header its ####    (a bit confusing since this is a 2nd level header in the rest of the file)
         In the rest of the file its <!-- regular html comment -->
-->

##### Inserting Figs, 2 ways.

  - Essential to use relative file paths
  - Essential to use Posix compatible paths

#### Filenames and Paths  

##### Filenames

  - No Spaces
  - No characters other than letters, numbers, - and underscore
  - Better not to capitalize
  - Or if you must, use CamelBacking

##### Paths

  - Windows is not Posix compatible
    - \ is not understood, must be typed \\
      - but should be /, 
    - / always works on Linux, Mac, Windows
  - Relative Paths
      - . i.e. dot, is the current folder
      - .. i.e. dot dot is the folder one above your current area
  - setwd (setting working directory) is bad to rely on.  



#### R Coding Training: For Loops

##### For loop basics

  - For loops are an important part for almost any coding problem
  - They work by applying an iterator that changes every time 
    - i is the standard iterator over a code block
    - but the iterator can be named anything) 

##### Common example, using a counter 

```{r}
# print out numbers upto a given num
num <- 5

for (i in 1:num) {
  print(i)
}
```

##### vectors or columns can also be iterated over

This can improve clarity in many cases 

  - if a counter is not needed

```{r}
letters <- c('a','b','c')

for (i in letters) {
  print(i)
}
```

##### Collecting for loop outputs

Lets say we want to calculate the square root of every value in a vector 

  - using a for loop, 
  - what is the problem with the code below?

```{r}
num <- c(4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42)

for (i in num) {
  result <- sqrt(i)
}

result
```

We only get 1 number when we wanted 6

  - Every time the loop iterates it overwrites the 'result' variable, 
    - leaving us with only the last value
  - There are multiple was to save out results, 
    - depending on what analysis you're running
  - I've found this to be one of the most straight forward ways

```{r}
num <- c(4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42)
# define a NULL variable to write into
all_results <- NULL

for (i in num) {
  # calculate the square root of i
  result <- sqrt(i)
  # concatinate the ith result onto the total result vector 
  # rbind() is also useful if the results have multiple variables (columns)
  all_results <- c(all_results, result)
}

all_results
```

- This gives us the answer we wanted

##### For loop drawbacks

For loops are highly fundamental 

  - But they have some problems
  - As seen in the example above, 
    - organizing results can be messy, 
    - especially with complicated results
  - They only run one process at a time, 
    - making them slow and 
    - unable to run parallel process
  - Later on we will look at ways to avoid for loops 
    - to improve code clarity and increase speed, 
    - as well as allow for parallel processing
    
Dplyr, Pipes and the Tidyverse

  - Help avoid the slow performance of For loops
  - And streamline/clarify the code
