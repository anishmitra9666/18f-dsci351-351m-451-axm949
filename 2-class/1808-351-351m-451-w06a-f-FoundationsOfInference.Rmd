#### Major Points for Distributions 

  - Normal distribution is the basis of statistical expectations
  - Geometric and Binomial Distributions are a form of expectations
  - For two different way of posing questions
  - Geometric: # of trials until success
  - Binomial: P(given # of successes in given # of trials)

##### Normal expectations 

  - pnorm, gives us the expected probability of a given observed sample value
  - for a given normal distribution
  
##### Skewness

  - normal distribution is symmetrical
  - if you have skewness (real data is "never" normal)
  - check if a variable transformation can reduce skewness
  - if so, then you statitstical analysis will be better

##### Convenient measures for normal distributions 

  - normalize the mean and standard deviation
  - using Z scores, so that you can cross-compare sample and population results
  - and check your normal expectations against your data
  - and
  - All of these normal distribution concepts
  - Are the foundation of statistical analysis
  - And of defining statistical significance
  - You'll be using them in HWs, Projs. and SemProjs.

#### Next we'll see the following

##### Central Limit Theorem

  - -> With Standard Errors (SE) 
  - -> and Confidence Intervals

##### Hypothesis Testing

  - -> test statistic
  - -> p values


##### Trials and Errors

  - -> Type I errors
  - -> Type II errors

#### Cee-lo dice game

-------------------------

##### Cee-lo without a bank (winner take all)

  In this version of the game, 
  
  - each round involves two or more players of equal status. 
  
  A bet amount is agreed upon and 
  
  - each player puts that amount in the pile or pot. 
    
  Each player then has to roll all three dice at once and 
  
  - must continue until a recognized combination is rolled. 
  
  Whichever player rolls the best combination 
  
  - wins the entire pot, and a new round begins. 
    
  In cases where two or more players tie for the best combination, 
  
  - they must have a shoot out to determine a single winner.

##### The combinations in Cee-lo

The combinations are similar to those described above, and can be ranked from best to worst as:

  * 4-5-6 
    - The highest possible roll. If you roll 4-5-6, you automatically win.
  * Trips 
    - Rolling three of the same number is known as rolling "trips". 
    - Higher trips beat lower trips, 
      - so 4-4-4 is better than   * 3-3-3. 
      - Any trips beats any established point.
  * Point 
    * Rolling a pair, and another number, 
      - establishes the singleton as a "point". 
    - A higher point beats a lower point, 
      - so 2-2-6 is better than 5-5-2.
  * 1-2-3
    * The lowest possible roll. 
    - If you roll 1-2-3, you automatically lose.
  * Any other roll is a meaningless combination and 
    - must be rerolled until one of the above combinations occurs.

--------------------------

#####Probabilities[edit]

  * With three six-sided dice there are 6 × 6 × 6 or 216 possible permutations.
    * 4-5-6: 6/216 = 2.777777778% (Automatic Win)
    * Trips: 6/216 = 2.777777778%
    * Point: 90/216 = 41.66666667%
    * 1-2-3: 6/216 = 2.777777778% (Automatic Loss)
    * Meaningless permutations: 108/216 = 50%
