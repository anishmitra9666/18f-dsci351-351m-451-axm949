#### We're starting to look at Distributions

  * Such as the Normal Distribution
    * On which much of our statistical inference is based.
  * Probability Distributions built up from samples of a population
  
#### For this we want to have a feeling for a few concepts

  * An Observation
    * And a sequence of observations
  * Sample Size
  * Fluctuations in outcomes
    * Humans are not good at appreciating Fluctuations
  * Priors, are previous observations
    * These are typically uncorrelated to the next observation
      * This is the Frequentist perspective
    * If we believe knowledge of Priors can inform us of the future
      * We are Bayesians, ie followers of Bayes' theorem
      
#### Are you a 

  * [Frequentist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequentist_inference)
    * This is safest
  * [Bayesian?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference)
    * This is coolest, but can be complicated to do correctly
