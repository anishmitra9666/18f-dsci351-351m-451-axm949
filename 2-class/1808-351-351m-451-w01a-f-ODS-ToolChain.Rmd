  6. Setup StackExchange account
  7. Setup Slack account
  8. Git Clone
  
  - 18-sdle-teatime
    - for quick introduction to data science techniques and tools
  - For Class-Prof Repo
    - Clone your forked Class Repo

#### Your Open Data Science Tool Chain

##### Its all about a Data Science Tool Chain

  - Use R and build on the communities foundatin
  - Use Rstudio as a comfy environment
  - Share your Open Data and Open Source Code
  - Produce Reproducible Science with Rmarkdown  
    + Use [Creative Commons Licenses](https://creativecommons.org/)
    + Or other [Open Source Licenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_free_and_open-source_software_licenses)
    + Such as the [Gnu Public License: GPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License)
    - Or one of my favorites, [the Apache License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_License)

###### Pilot your Data Science studies using available data

  - Find available data sets
  - Before starting the costly process of making data

###### Use Git repositories

  - For Code Version Control
  - For Collaboration
  - For Open Science sharing
  
##### Online Git Server Communities

  - We use [BitBucket Account](http://bitbucket.org)
    - In class, for our class code repositories
    - These are private repositories
  - You'll probably also want a [GitHub](http://github.com/) account.
    - Many Rprojects are there, and 
    - you can fork their repo's as inspect the code very easily.

##### Kaggle Account

  - [Kaggle](http://www.kaggle.com) started as a data science competition site
  - Its recently been bought by Google
    - And give free R and Python Notebooks
    - Including use of free GPUs
  - It has a very good [Intro to R, Python, Machine Learning etc.](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview)
    - First R Tutorial: [Getting staRted in R: First Steps](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/getting-started-in-r-first-steps/)
    - 2nd [R Tutorial, Level 1, on Modeling](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/r)
    - 3rd [R Tutorial, Level 2, on tidyverse data manipulation](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/manipulating-data-with-the-tidyverse) 

##### Twitter used for Data Science

As part of setting up our Data Science Tool Chain

  - Signup for a Twitter account 
  - [Using Twitter in university research](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/files/2011/11/Published-Twitter_Guide_Sept_2011.pdf)
  - [10 Commandments of Twitter for Academics](http://chronicle.com/article/10-Commandments-of-Twitter-for/131813/)

##### Sign up for a Stack Exchange Account

Stack Exchange, Stack Overflow

  - are a Q&A community focused on many topics.  

Stack Overflow allows you to search by tag

  - r and rmarkdown are useful tags for SO

###### [Stack Exchange's Tour of Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/tour)  

###### Specific Stack Exchange websites

  - for [SX Data Science](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/)                             
  - for [SX Statistics on Cross Validated](http://stats.stackexchange.com/) 
  - for [SX Open Data](http://opendata.stackexchange.com/)             

##### Efficiently browse you SX sites

  - Google (but more random)
  - [The Stack Exchange apps](http://stackapps.com/) 
  - Using an [RSS Feed reader such as Feedly](http://feedly.com/i/latest) is a good way


##### Slack, another component of Agile Sofware Development

  - [Slack.com](https://slack.com/)
    - We have a [CWRU DSCI Slack room](http://cwru-dsci.slack.com)
    - There is Slack app for phones
    - And client for computers, its on vdi.
    - Slack client available for windows, mac and Linux
  - an online collaboration tool

#### You Online Data Science Portfolio

  - Doing open, reproducible data science
  - Lets you share a portfolio of codes and projects
  - Cite it in your resume
  - Build a community of supporters and collaborators
  
##### An Example, Emeline Liu

  - [emelineliu.com](http://emelineliu.com/)
    -  This website, which runs off of [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), is my latest project. 
    - Right now, I'm using [Poole](http://getpoole.com/) as a foundation for my website/blog.
