***

#### Midterm

  - Testing Concepts, OpenIntro Stats, and Learning R, Learning Rstudio 
  - Your Data Science Tool Chain
  - Open and Reproducible Science
  - Steps in Data Analysis
  - Done as Rmd and Rscripts
  
##### Midterm is open book / open resource
  
  - The midterm will be given as an Rmd
  - You will work in the Rmd file
  - Writing and doing Rcode chunks
  - You have the resources of 
  - - Your repository
  - - R Help
  - - Other online resources
  - Open Data Science Approach
  - - What can you accomplish
  - - Using all available resources
  
##### Midterm Does Not Cover Foundations of Inference 

  - Foundations of Inference (OIS-4)
  - Inference for Numerical Data (OIS-5)
  - Inference for Categorical Data (OIS-6)

##### Topics Covered In Class

  - both Foundations and Practicum topics 
  

#### Midterm Concepts e. g. Open Data Science, Data Analysis, EDA, Visualiation

  - Git, Rstudio, R, R packages
  - Graphics, Base and GGPlot2
  - Data Assembly, Cleaning
  - Exploratory Data Analysis
  - Tidyverse: Pipes, dplyr, mutate etc. 
  - Study Design
  - Sampling and Populations
  - Other topics

###### Data Science Tool Chain

#### R statistics programming language 
  
  - \> 8000 packages, free and open source software (FOSS)

Python

  - Also a good statistical environment
  - not as well developed for stats
  - but better are substantial number crunching

There are many other stats softwares and languages

  - SPSS, SAS, STATA, 
    - But these are not useful for automated analysis
  
##### But Excel, or mousey/mousey programs are not for data science

  - Can not record the sequential processing
    - i.e. the script of your analysis
  - don't lead to reproducible and open science
  - can't distribute code, data and analysis and report

##### IDE (Integrated Development Environment)

  - Comfortable environment for getting going
  - Rstudio for R, 
  - Spyder or Eclipse with PyDev for Python

##### Yet everything can be done at command line

  - This enables automation 
  - And large scale analysis
  - Using scripting (bash scripting)
  - Simple automation

##### Git Repositories for content versioning

  - Can pursue branches and revert to earlier versions
  - Enables collaboration
  - Robust code review
  - Fork and develop in a community
  - IDEs support Git Versioning
  
##### Markdown languages

  - Enable integrated reports, code, data in repositories
  - RMarkdown2 for R
  - iPython Notebooks for Python
  - And Report can autoupdate with a simple re-compile

Direction towards interactive data science

##### Literate Programming (or Open/Reproducible Data Science)

Finally, we note that the interweaving of code and text (often referred to as literate
programming) may serve two purposes. 

  - The first is to generate a data analysis report by executing code to produce the result. 
  - The second is to document the code itself, for example, 
  - - by describing the purpose of a function and all its arguments. 
  
  The latter purpose will be discussed with the Roxygen2 package for code documentation.


#### What is a Data Analysis

##### Steps in a Data Analysis

  - Define the question
  - Define the ideal data set
  - Determine what data you can access
  - Obtain the data (Open/Available Data first for pilot study)
  - Clean the data
  - Exploratory data analysis
  - Statistical prediction/modeling
  - Interpret results
  - Challenge results
  - Synthesize/write up results
  - Create reproducible code

##### Open Intro Stats: OI-1 Intro to Data

  - Data basics
  - Overview of data collection principles
  - Observational studies and sampling strategies
  - Experiments
  - Examining numerical data
  - Considering categorical data


#### THE FOLLOWING TOPICS NOT ON MIDTERM: Inferential Statistics

##### OI-3 Distributions of Random Variables

  - Normal distribution
  - Evaluating the normal approximation
  - Geometric distribution
  - Binomial distribution
  
##### OI-4 Foundations of Inference  (Not on Exam)

  - Variability in estimates
  - Confidence intervals
  - Hypothesis intervals
  - Examining the central limit theorem
  - Inference for other estimators
  - Sample size and power
  - Statistical vs. practical significance
  
##### So Things to know (Not on Exam)

  - Z values ( # of sd's away from mean)
  - zstar values
  - normal probability plots
  - How to form a hypothesis for hypothesis testing
  - p values
  - Type I and II errors
  - alpha and beta values
  - census vs. sampling
  - observational studies, controlled studies
  - prospective studies and retrospective studies
  - IQRs interquartile ranks
  - SE (standard error of an estimate)
  - SE of the sample mean
  - population values vs. point estimates: mu vs xbar
  - Confidence Intervals, 95% CIs
  

##### Conditions for xbar being nearly normal and SE being accurate (Not on Exam)

Important conditions to help ensure the sampling distribution of x is nearly normal and the estimate of SE sufficiently accurate:

  - The sample observations are independent.
  - The sample size is large: n = 30 (or n > 30) is a good rule of thumb.
  - The distribution of sample observations is not strongly skewed.

Additionally, the larger the sample size, 
  - the more lenient we can be with the sampleâ€™s skew.
