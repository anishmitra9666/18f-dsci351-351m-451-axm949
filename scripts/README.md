# This is the `scripts` folder in the standard SDLE git repository structure

The `scripts` folder is meant to contain scripts and functions at various stages of completion.

Files in this folder ideally run without errors and do something useful, but may not be working properly or may not be fully optimized.

Code in these files should pull data from within the data folder in the repo, or from outside of the repo.
Any output from the code should likewise be saved outside of the repo.

The ultimate goal is to write the functional code from these scripts out into functions and coalesce these functions into packages.
Ideally scripts contain minimal code, and bring in the majority of their functionality from reusable generalized functions found within packages.
